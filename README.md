## Getting Started <a name="started"></a>

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

These are the software needed:
* Python (3.5+)
* Pip
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter
* Scikit-Learn
* Pytorch

### Files <a name="files"></a>
* Ignore.ipynb: Code for reproducability of U-ignore
* ChexpertMultiClass.ipynb: Code for reproducability of U-Multiclass
* SemiSupervised.ipynb: Code for reproducability of U-SemiSupervised
* Siamese_Enlarged_Cardio.ipynb: Code for siamese network on Enlarged Cardio
* Siamese_Lung_Lesion.ipynb: Code for siamese network on Lung Lesion


## Running Code <a name="code"></a>
Each jupyter notebook has both the training code and evaluation code. If you train a new model, you need to get the name of the saved model and edit it in the notebook to test the model. There are pre-defined models that we have trained and put in the respective folders.
